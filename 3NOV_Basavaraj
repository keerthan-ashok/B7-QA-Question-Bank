5. What are two types of authorization?
i) Matrix-based security:
This authorization scheme allows for granular control over which users and groups are able to perform which actions in the Jenkins environment
ii) Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy
This authorization scheme is an extension to Matrix-based security which allows additional access control lists (ACLs) to be defined for each project separately in the Project configuration screen. This allows granting specific users or groups access only to specified projects, instead of all projects in the Jenkins environment.
